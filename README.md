# Basic QR Reader and Login App

This project is a foundational application developed to understand QR code scanning and implement a simple login functionality before advancing to a more complex QR-based product tracking system during my internship at TAMSData. The app works with standard QR code formats using Google's ML Kit.

## Project Overview

The app was created as a preliminary project to gain experience with QR code scanning and user authentication before developing a more advanced application at TAMSData. It includes a simple user login system and a QR code reader that utilizes Googleâ€™s ML Kit for detecting and reading standard QR code types.

### Features

- **QR Code Scanning**: Uses Google ML Kit to scan and decode standard QR code formats.
- **User Login**: Basic login functionality to authenticate users before scanning QR codes.
- **Real-Time QR Reading**: Scans QR codes in real-time and displays the decoded information on the screen.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Android app (Java)
- **QR Scanning**: ML Kit (Google's Machine Learning Kit)

## Usage

1. **Login**: Users must log in to access the QR scanning feature.
2. **Scan QR Codes**: Use the app to scan standard QR codes, which are then processed and displayed in real-time.
